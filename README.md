## Music Store

As an aspiring data analyst, I recently completed a music store data project using MySQL. This diverse project involved working with multiple tables, utilizing join functions, creating CTE tables, and implementing inner and subqueries. Through this project, I gained valuable skills in SQL queries, enhancing my understanding and ability to find answers to various questions.
