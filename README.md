## Music Store Analysis

### Project Overview:

Welcome to the Music Store Sales Analysis Project, where we delve into the world of data analysis using SQL to unlock insights into music sales, customer behavior, and the performance of the music store. This comprehensive project covers a range of complex SQL queries, database manipulations, and insightful analyses.

### Project Objectives:

***Employee Analysis***: Identify the senior-most employee based on their job title.

***Customer Insights***: Determine the country with the most invoices, as well as the city with the highest-quality customers.

***Music Festival Planning***: Discover the city with the highest total invoices, aiding in the planning of a promotional Music Festival.

***Best Customer***: Identify the customer who has spent the most, earning the title of the best customer.

***Rock Music Listeners***: Compile a list of email addresses, first names, last names, and genres of all rock music listeners, sorted alphabetically by email.

***Top Rock Bands***: Uncover the top 10 rock bands by their track count.

***Longest Songs***: Find and list the track names with song lengths longer than the average song length, ordering by the longest songs first.

***Customer Spending on Artists***: Determine the amount spent by each customer on artists and provide a report listing customer names, artist names, and the total spent.

***Popular Genre by Country***: Identify the most popular music genre for each country based on purchase data.

***Top Customers by Country***: Recognize the customer that has spent the most on music in each country.

### The Analysis:

In this project, we apply SQL to real-world sales data to extract valuable insights about employees, customers, music genres, and artist performance. Through a series of complex queries, we explore trends, discover best customers, and provide data-driven recommendations for music store management.
